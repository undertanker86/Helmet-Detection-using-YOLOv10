# YOLOv10 Helmet Detection

This project uses YOLOv10 to detect helmets in images. The model is fine-tuned and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive interface.

## Features

- Detect helmets in uploaded images.
- Display annotated images with bounding boxes around detected helmets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Conda
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics YOLOv10
